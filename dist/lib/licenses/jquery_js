Source Code

jQuery Foundation projects are released under the terms of the license specified in the project's repo or if not specified, under the MIT license.

The MIT License is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with a jQuery Foundation project.

You are free to use any jQuery Foundation project in any other project (even commercial projects) as long as the copyright header is left intact.

link Sample Code

All demos and examples, whether in a code project's repository or displayed on a project site, are released under the terms of the license as specified in the code repository. Many jQuery Foundation projects choose to release their sample code under the terms of CC0.

CC0 is even more permissive than the MIT license, allowing you to use the code in any manner you want, without any copyright headers, notices, or other attribution.

link Web Sites

The content on jQuery Foundation web sites are released under the terms of the license specified in the website's repo or if not specified, under the MIT license.

The design, layout, and look-and-feel of jQuery web sites are not licensed for use and may not be used on any site, personal or commercial, without prior written consent from the jQuery Foundation.
